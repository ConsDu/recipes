# A Salads App built with React and React Router

I have a keen interest in all types of salads because I genuinely love them, and since I had to practice some React concepts, such as React Router and Context, I've built this straightforward recipes app where you can find many salads by category.

The purpose of this app is to provide you with an easy-to-use database of salad recipes. This app is ideal for those who are always on the go because making these salads is easy, fast and only requires just ingredients, plus you will be eating healthy.

Currently the app language is only available in Spanish and the recipes database is not complete (super busy lately).

## Features

- Browse salad by category
- Bookmark your favorite ones
- Click the name of the salad and open it on an individual page
- Click the share button and copy-to-clipboard the individual salad link
- Click each ingredient and open a new google search tab for it
- Click the 3 dots you will expand the instructions section

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, React Router, BoostrapCSS

**Server:** Currently just fetching a static JSON file
